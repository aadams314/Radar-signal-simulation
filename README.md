Experimental software to generate synthetic radar signals
Purpose: to generate known synthetic radar type signals (pulsed) with different modulations (AM, FM, phase) for ML algorithm research.
Instructions: Modify main program file simulation parameters to generate different experimental data sets.  Results plotted on graphs and save to text files.
